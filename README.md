# Slack Acronym Expander
---

Feed in acronyms and get back their meaning. 

## Setup
**TODO**

## Usage
`/acronym [acronym]` from your Slack prompt. Only you will see the command and the response.

## Acknowledgements
I was inspired by coworkers, who made a *leather bound book* of our day to day acronyms.
