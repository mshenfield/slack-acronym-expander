# Slack Acronym Expander

Feed in acronyms and get back their meaning. 

## Setup
**TODO**

## Alternatives
I had a lot of fun making this, but there is a much more robust alternative created by codeforamera that serves the same purpose, plus does a lot more: [Glossary Bot](https://github.com/codeforamerica/glossary-bot)

## Usage
`/acronym [acronym]` from your Slack prompt. Only you will see the command and the response.
